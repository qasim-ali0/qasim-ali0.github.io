Hi! I'm Qasim Ali, a graduate student at the University of Waterloo, advised by [Alex Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-wong-90650216/) and [Javad Shafiee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-javad-shafiee-61bbaa49/).

I'm interested in building and using world models to help agents take better actions. While LLMs are great at solving simple tasks, I think systems with multi-step reasoning and planning ([System 2 reasoning](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/system-1-and-system-2-thinking)) will require other approaches like Yann LeCun's [JEPA](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf) or [Neural Turing Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401). As an engineer, I operate at the intersection of generative AI, reinforcement learning, and representation learning, working to bring this vision to fruition.

Previously, I studied Mechatronics Engineering at McMaster University and interned at Magna Electronics ADAS division. During that time I worked with Embedded Software to help get self-driving features working on real vehicles, built a control algorithm for getting vehicles to navigate through V2I-connected intersections, and built a [drone](https://drive.google.com/file/d/125z5QsjDenNSf7ONLg8X_LwHTOxepNVv/view).

Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bd0TkF0AAAAJ&hl=en), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-ali23/), or some of my [publications](/publications/).
