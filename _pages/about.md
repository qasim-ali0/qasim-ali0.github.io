Hi! I'm Qasim Ali, a graduate student at the University of Waterloo studying AI. I am advised by [Alex Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-wong-90650216/) and [Javad Shafiee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-javad-shafiee-61bbaa49/) in the Systems Engineering Department.

I'm interested in building and using *World Models* ðŸŒŽ to help agents take better actions. While LLMs are great at solving simple tasks, I think [*System 2 Reasoning ðŸ§ *](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/system-1-and-system-2-thinking) will require alternative architectures like [JEPA](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf) or [Neural Turing Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401). During my master's degree, I worked at the intersection of **generative models**, **reinforcement learning**, and **representation learning** on ideas related to this vision.

I come from a embedded software and robotics background. I did my undergrad in Mechatronics Engineering from McMaster University and interned at [Magna Electronic's](https://www.magna.com/company/company-information/magna-groups/magna-electronics) **ADAS division**. During that time I worked with various **embedded software** platforms to help get self-driving features working real-time on vehicles, built a control algorithm for getting vehicles to navigate through V2I-connected intersections, and built a [*drone*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/125z5QsjDenNSf7ONLg8X_LwHTOxepNVv/view).

If you're into AI research, robotics, or just want to chat about the future of agents ðŸ¤– â€” feel free to connect.

P.S. I'm graduating soon â€” if you're looking for people in AI or robotics to join your team, I'd love to connect.
