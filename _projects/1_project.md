A senior capstone project focused on building an autonomous aerial system to assess real-time parking lot occupancy using onboard computer vision.

This project combined robotics, embedded systems, and computer vision to tackle a real-world logistics challenge. We designed, built, and deployed a quadcopter drone capable of autonomously navigating above parking lots and capturing live footage. We used the Navio flight controller.
