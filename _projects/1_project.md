A senior capstone project focused on building an **autonomous aerial system** 🎮🚁 to assess real-time **parking lot occupancy** 🅿️🚗 using onboard computer vision.

This project combined robotics, embedded systems, and computer vision to tackle a logistics challenge. We designed, built, and deployed a quadcopter drone capable of autonomously navigating above parking lots and capturing live footage. We used the [Navio](https://navio2.hipi.io/) flight controller and Raspberry Pi.
