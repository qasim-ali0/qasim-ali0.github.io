How well do you know large language models?

This short, interactive [Google Slides quiz](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dvnVDBSXkFvtzyOeEmtcJrpicqvaJeiRHMOZM-QjEos/edit?usp=sharing) walks through **30 curated questions** designed to test your intuition and knowledge of LLMs â€” from transformer internals to LLM data. The questions were created from reading ~10 core NLP papers.

> These arenâ€™t just trivia â€” theyâ€™re meant to surface subtle points, common misconceptions, and important details how we build LLMs.

Whether youâ€™re just getting into LLMs or already working with them daily, youâ€™ll likely find a few surprises inside.

#### Sample Topics Covered
- What *data* does the LLM see during pre-training?
- What *tokens* are actually used by the LLM?
- What do causal *attention masks* actually look like? 
Grab a coffee, try the quiz, and share it with a colleague to compare answers.
